Project: Next.js 14 app router + TypeScript

Responsibilities
- Prefer server components. Use `"use client"` only when hooks, refs, or event handlers are required.
- Keep API routes under `app/api/*` lean and sideâ€‘effect free except for I/O.
- Centralize shared utilities under `app/lib/*`.

API Route Guidelines
- Validate request JSON; return 400 for missing fields.
- Use `NextResponse.json` with typed generics for responses.
- Catch and map errors to 5xx; never leak stack traces.

MongoDB
- Use the connection utilities in `app/lib/mongodb.ts`.
- Ensure `MONGODB_URI` is required. Do not create new clients per request.
- When listing feedbacks, sort by `createdAt` desc and paginate.

UI
- Stick to existing `app/components/*` patterns and Tailwind classes in `app/globals.css`.
- Keep components pure; lift state up, avoid prop drilling via context only when needed.

Performance
- Use dynamic `force-static`/`force-dynamic` only intentionally.
- Avoid loading large libraries on the client.

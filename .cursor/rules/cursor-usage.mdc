### Cursor Usage

- **Context**: Keep diffs small and focused. Provide file paths and goals explicitly.
- **Rules**: Prefer `.mdc` rules with `globs` for scoping; avoid global rules unless necessary.
- **Secrets**: Never paste secrets; use placeholders and reference sources (AWS Secrets Manager/K8s Secret).
- **Edits**: Ask the agent to apply edits via file paths; avoid dumping long code in chat.
- **Validation**: After edits, run fmt/lint/tests/build. For infra, dryâ€‘run K8s and validate Terraform.
- **Repro**: Share exact commands and env vars used to reproduce issues.
